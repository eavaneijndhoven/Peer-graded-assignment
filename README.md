# Peer-graded-assignment

## Introduction

## Data set
Data was collected data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## File overview
The following files are included in the repository:

- `Codebook.md`: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations used to transform the data into a tidy dataset
- `run_analysis.R`: Rscript that transforms the data  into the tidy dataset saved as `tidydata.txt`
- `tidydata.txt`: The tidy data set that is the output from running the Rscript `run_analysis.R`
