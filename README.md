Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The following files are included in the repository:

- Codebook.md: A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations used to transform the data into a tidy dataset
- run_analysis.R: Rscript that transforms the data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" into the tidy dataset saved as tidydata.txt
- tidydata.txt: The tidy data set that is the output from running the Rscript run_analysis.R
